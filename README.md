HI!!! I'm Rose! A silly girl who yaps and draws a lot.. if you're reading this, you probably saw me on ponytown so, HI! I love making new friends so I don't mind if you come up to chat! (I'm USUALLY scared to start a conversation first)

I don't really care what pronouns you use, I prefer she/her but it's not a bother if you want to use he/they, I don't mind at all! ^_^
I'm usually in the Sonic area or chilling near the bakery with my boyfriend! (I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!) 
I'm in a lot of fandoms so if you wanna know, check out my strawpages made by my amazing bf!! ❤️ 

Online- HIII!!!

Busy- Using chilling and I don't wanna be bothered (Unless your my bf, sis, or friends!)

Away- Afk, away from my computer, leave a whisp if you need anything!

(I don't roleplay as it makes me uncomfortable, pls don't ask)

Don't flirt.. even as a joke, I'm happily taken, thank you.
